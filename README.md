### Notes:
- **Development Process:** The first commit includes all the code because I initially developed the game in an "experiment" repository. Once the logic was complete, I refactored and improved it before transferring it to this repository.
- **Custom String Formatting:** Instead of relying on gems like ```colorize```, I extended Ruby's ```String``` class with custom methods for text styling. This ensures compatibility and makes it easier for users to run the game without installing additional dependencies.
